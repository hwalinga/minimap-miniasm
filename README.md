This program consists of two subprograms, minimap, and miniasm.

You can run one or the other using the first argument, followed by the other
arguments.

For example:
python3 hielkewalinga_4374561_minimap-miniasm.py minimap query.fq target.fq > output.paf

For more details, you can use the --help flag to one of the subprograms:
python3 hielkewalinga_4374561_minimap-miniasm.py miniasm --help

The main program accepts a --help as well.

NB.

There is also a third subprogram, which is the 'test' subprogram. This will
run the unittest included in this program.

There is also a fourth subprogram 'mytest', used for debugging.
